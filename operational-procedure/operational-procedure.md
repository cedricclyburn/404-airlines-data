## 1. Flight Operations

### 1.1 Pre-Flight Procedures

- **Flight Planning**: All flights must be planned using the latest METAR and TAF data. Flight plans should be filed at least 60 minutes before departure. Pilots must review NOTAMs and ensure compliance with all airspace restrictions.

- **Aircraft Inspection**: Pilots must conduct a thorough pre-flight inspection using the standardized checklist. Any discrepancies must be reported to Maintenance Control. Special attention should be given to fuel levels, control surfaces, and emergency equipment.

- **Crew Briefing**: A mandatory crew briefing covering weather, NOTAMs, and any operational concerns must be conducted before each flight. This briefing should also include a review of emergency procedures and coordination among crew members.

- **Passenger Briefing**: Prior to departure, passengers must be briefed on safety procedures, including the use of seat belts, emergency exits, and oxygen masks. Special instructions should be provided to passengers seated in exit rows.

### 1.2 In-Flight Procedures

- **Cruise Monitoring**: Pilots are to monitor fuel consumption and engine performance every 30 minutes. Any anomalies should be reported immediately. Regular checks of navigation systems and weather conditions along the route are also required.

- **Navigation**: Use of RNAV procedures is mandatory where available. Deviations must be approved by Air Traffic Control (ATC). Pilots should cross-check navigation data with onboard systems to ensure accuracy.

- **Cabin Surveillance**: Flight attendants must conduct regular cabin checks to ensure passenger compliance with safety regulations and to identify any potential issues.

### 1.3 Post-Flight Procedures

- **Shutdown Checklist**: Complete the shutdown checklist upon arrival. Ensure all systems are powered down correctly. Particular attention should be given to securing the aircraft and setting parking brakes.

- **Post-Flight Inspection**: Conduct a walk-around inspection to identify any potential issues. Log findings in the Aircraft Technical Log. Any maintenance issues must be communicated to Maintenance Control before the next flight.

- **Debriefing**: Crew members should participate in a post-flight debriefing to discuss any operational issues encountered and to provide feedback for continuous improvement.

## 2. Ground Operations

### 2.1 Ramp Safety

- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: All ground personnel must wear high-visibility vests, hearing protection, and safety boots. PPE must be worn at all times on the ramp.

- **Vehicle Operation**: Ground vehicles must adhere to speed limits and designated pathways. Unauthorized vehicles are prohibited on the ramp. Drivers must be trained and certified for airside operations.

- **FOD Control**: Regular inspections for Foreign Object Debris (FOD) must be conducted. All personnel are responsible for maintaining a clean and safe ramp area.

### 2.2 Refueling Procedures

- **Fuel Quality Check**: Before refueling, verify fuel quality certificates and ensure filters are in place. Only approved fuel suppliers are to be used.

- **Communication**: Maintain open communication between the refueling team and cockpit crew during the process. Use standard hand signals and radio communication as necessary.

- **Safety Measures**: Ensure proper grounding of the aircraft during refueling. No electronic devices or open flames are permitted within 50 feet of the refueling area.

### 2.3 Aircraft Towing and Parking

- **Towing Procedures**: Only trained personnel are authorized to tow aircraft. Use approved tow bars and ensure all safety pins are in place. Communication between the towing team and cockpit crew is essential.

- **Parking**: Aircraft must be parked in designated areas with wheel chocks in place. Parking brakes should be set, and control locks applied. Ensure adequate clearance from other aircraft and obstacles.

- **Securing Aircraft**: In adverse weather conditions, additional securing measures such as tie-downs may be required. Follow manufacturer guidelines for securing specific aircraft types.

## 3. Emergency Procedures

### 3.1 Engine Failure

- **During Takeoff**: If an engine failure occurs before V1, abort the takeoff. After V1, continue takeoff and follow the Engine Failure After V1 checklist. Pilots must be familiar with engine-out procedures specific to their aircraft type.

- **In-Flight**: Identify the failed engine, secure it, and proceed to the nearest suitable airport. Declare an emergency with ATC and follow standard operating procedures for single-engine
 
### 3.2 Cabin Decompression

- **Immediate Actions**: Don oxygen masks, initiate emergency descent to 10,000 feet, and inform ATC. Monitor cabin altitude and rate of descent closely.

- **Passenger Communication**: Use the PA system to instruct passengers to use oxygen masks and remain seated. Ensure cabin crew assist passengers as needed.

- **Post-Event Procedures**: Once at a safe altitude, assess the situation, check for any injuries, and prepare for a possible diversion if necessary.

### 3.3 Fire Onboard

- **Detection**: Identify the source of smoke or fire promptly. Utilize onboard fire detection systems and visual inspection.

- **Suppression**: Use appropriate fire extinguishers (e.g., Halon for electrical fires) and follow the fire suppression checklist.

- **Communication**: Inform ATC of the situation, declare an emergency, and prepare for an immediate landing if required.

### 3.4 Evacuation Procedures

- **Decision to Evacuate**: The Captain makes the final decision to evacuate. Consider factors such as fire, smoke, fuel leaks, and structural damage.

- **Evacuation Commands**: Use clear and assertive commands to instruct passengers to evacuate. Utilize all available exits and slides.

- **Post-Evacuation**: Account for all passengers and crew. Provide first aid as necessary and await emergency services.

## 4. Communication Protocols

### 4.1 Standard Phraseology

- **ATC Communication**: Use ICAO standard phraseology to prevent misunderstandings. Examples include:

  - "Cleared for takeoff"
  - "Requesting descent to FL350"
  - "Holding short of runway 27"

- **Internal Communication**: Maintain clear and concise communication between cockpit and cabin crew. Use standard calls such as:

  - "Cabin secure for takeoff"
  - "Ready for landing checklist"

### 4.2 Emergency Communication

- **Mayday Calls**: In life-threatening situations, transmit a Mayday call with aircraft identification, nature of emergency, intentions, and position.

- **Pan-Pan Calls**: For urgent situations that are not immediately life-threatening, use Pan-Pan calls with relevant details.

### 4.3 Crew Resource Management (CRM)

- **Principles**: Encourage open communication, mutual respect, and shared decision-making among crew members.

- **Application**: Utilize CRM techniques during normal and emergency operations to enhance safety and efficiency.

## 5. Security Procedures

### 5.1 Passenger Screening

- **Procedures**: Ensure all passengers undergo security screening as per TSA guidelines. Prohibited items must be confiscated.

- **Behavioral Observation**: Train staff to recognize suspicious behavior and report concerns to security personnel.

### 5.2 Baggage Handling

- **Checked Baggage**: Screen all checked baggage using X-ray machines and explosive detection systems.

- **Carry-On Baggage**: Monitor carry-on items for compliance with size and content regulations.

### 5.3 Restricted Area Access
